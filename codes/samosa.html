<h2 align="center" style="color:green">SAMOSA</h2>
<p>SAMOSA is Widely considered a quintessentially Indian delicacy, few people know that the samosa does not have an Indian origin. Yes, you read that right. The deep fried, tightly pack of spicy goodness that we thought belonged to India is actually a delicious and well-travelled immigrant from Central Asia.A traditional samosa is made with a mixture of maida flour (a white wheat flour that can be substituted with all-purpose flour), vegetable oil or butter, salt, and water. Traditional samosa dough is often flavored with carom seeds.It is good,but don't ate every day.</p>
