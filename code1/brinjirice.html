<body>
<p>Call it Brinji Rice, Brinji Sadam or just Brinji, it doesn’t change the fact that this delicacy from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu is going to be the most flavorful and easy way you can have a satisfying one-pot vegan meal. Dunk rice, an earthy ground green masala paste, some veggies, whole spices and coconut milk in a pot, and wait till it simmers into this beautiful filling dish. You literally won’t need anything else to go with it as it is so delicious by itself.</p>
