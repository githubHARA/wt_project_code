<h2 align="center">MOMO</H2>
<P>The vegetables and chicken used inside momos are stale or of a very poor standard. In fact, most of the chicken products that you get at unhygienic, cheap outlets test positive for E. coli bacteria, a powerful toxin that can cause severe illnesses.We all love momos, but did you know that they are harmful for our health? These round soft dough balls are filled with juicy veg or non-veg stuffings and are served with a spicy dip. They are the delight of all street food lovers. But momos are dangerous for health and can cause long-term damages to the body.</p>
