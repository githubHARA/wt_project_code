<p>Traditional mutton korma or gosht korma is a rich Lucknowi stew of lamb or goat meat slow cooked in brown onions, nuts, spices, yogurt and aromatic essences like saffron and kewda (screw pine). The aura of this korma is unique, rich, smooth, delicate and exceptional.Though often dismissed as a fatty meat, in flavor, not much can compete with a good mutton curry. The meat from an adult goat, mutton has its benefits too â€“ it contains high quality protein, essential amino acids and high levels of valuable micronutrients including iron, zinc and vitamin B.
