<P>If thereâ€™s one more integral dish of the Indian street food culture, it is the Aloo Tikki. Made with aloo (potatoes), spices and herbs these crispy, crusty and oh-so-good tikki (patties) are loved just as it is or as part of other preparations like a chaat, etc. This post has the basic Aloo Tikki recipe, plus  perked it up with a savory green peas stuffing (that can be easily given a miss). These perfectly spiced and herby potato patties are delicious, but the addition of green peas only makes them better.It is highly carbohydrates food.It is nat bad to health</p>
