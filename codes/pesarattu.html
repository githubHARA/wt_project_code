<body>
<p>Pesarattu recipe can be made with whole moong beans or split yellow moong lentils. I usually make Pesarattu with both whole green moong dal and the split husked yellow mung lentils. The pesarattu recipe made with yellow moong lentils has a texture similar to the North Indian Moong Chilla.Moong dal is a great source of protein, vitamins and dietary fiber.</p>
