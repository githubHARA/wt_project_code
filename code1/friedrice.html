<body>
<p>Use cold, leftover cooked rice. Left in the fridge overnight, the rice grains will firm up, making it easier to separate and decreasing the chances of your fried rice turning out mushy. If you can't wait, air freshly cooked rice to remove moisture and refrigerate the rice for a few hours before cooking.</p>
