<body>
<p>This is a spicy mutton curry prepared with "gongura" or sorrel leaves. The combination of the distinct sour taste of the sorrel leaves and the flavour of spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf, garlic and ginger, makes this curry a treat for the taste buds.Gongura is an excellent source of folate and a very good source of vitamin B6, both of which are needed to maintain low homocysteine levels. Apart from this, it is a rich source of iron, vitamin C, anti-oxidants, calcium, iron, zinc and vitamin A</p>
